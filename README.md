# TokenGenerator
Python-based Event Token Generator that creates a QR code as a temporary ID for participants. Users enter their name, roll number, department, and event name, which are encoded into a QR code image. Event managers can scan this QR code for quick participant verification, making event management efficient without physical ID cards.
